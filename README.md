# Avetta Rules audio features :musical_note:
I requested the Spotify API with Python to analyze the audio features of my favourite songs in my playlist Avetta Rules. Are they danceble, energetic, positive or negative? Well, the results didn't surpraised me, I know the music I listen to is so energetic.
I used the following libraries:
* Spotipy
* Pandas
* Seaborn

If you want to use this code, please, take into account that you need to complete the script with your own Spotify API client and secret ID.
